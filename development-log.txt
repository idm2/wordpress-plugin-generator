## [2024-05-25] Port Conflict and Resource Loading Issues

### Issue
- Application running on port 3002 but browser trying to access resources on port 3001
- ChunkLoadError: Loading chunk app-client-internals failed
- Module not found: Can't resolve 'encoding' in node-fetch/lib
- Multiple renderers concurrently rendering the same context provider

### Analysis
- Port conflict: The server is running on port 3002 (as ports 3000 and 3001 were already in use)
- Browser is attempting to load resources from incorrect port (3001)
- Missing 'encoding' dependency for node-fetch which is used by OpenAI package
- Hydration errors occurring due to client/server mismatch

### Required Actions
1. Install missing 'encoding' dependency:
   ```bash
   npm install encoding
   ```
2. Clear Next.js cache and rebuild:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. Ensure consistent port usage by explicitly setting port in next.config.js
4. Restart the development server with clean cache

### Expected Results
- Resources loaded from correct port
- No more ChunkLoadError
- Proper hydration of React components
- Application running without console errors
