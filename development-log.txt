# Development Log

## 2024-02-15 - Application Restoration and Fixes

### Changes Made:
1. Updated OpenAI Vision model configuration
   - Changed from 'gpt-4o-mini' to 'gpt-4-vision-preview'
   - Updated default OpenAI model from 'gpt-3.5-turbo' to 'gpt-4'
   - File modified: src/config/env.ts

2. Updated OpenAI Chat model to GPT-4 Turbo
   - Changed default model from 'gpt-4-turbo-preview' to 'gpt-4-turbo'
   - File modified: src/config/env.ts
   - This change ensures consistent model usage across the application

3. Updated OpenAI Vision model to GPT-4 Turbo
   - Changed from 'gpt-4-vision-preview' to 'gpt-4-turbo'
   - File modified: src/config/env.ts
   - This aligns with OpenAI's latest documentation for image analysis

### Issues Identified:
1. OpenAI Vision model was incorrectly configured
2. OpenAI API key format may need updating (currently using project-based format)
3. Multiple AI model integrations need verification (OpenAI, DeepSeek, QWEN)

### Next Steps:
1. Verify OpenAI API key format and update if necessary
2. Test image analysis functionality with corrected vision model
3. Verify other AI model integrations
