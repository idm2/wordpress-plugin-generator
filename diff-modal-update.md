# DiffViewModal Enhancement - June 24, 2024

## Issue Identified
- The DiffViewModal wasn't filling the entire screen, limiting the space for viewing code changes
- Code blocks in the diff view lacked proper vertical scrolling, making it difficult to view long files
- Users couldn't see the complete code changes without excessive scrolling of the entire modal

## Analysis
- The modal's size was constrained to 95% of viewport width and height
- Code blocks had horizontal scrolling but lacked proper vertical scrolling
- The file tree column was taking up too much space (1/4 of the modal width)

## Changes Made
1. **Expanded Modal Size**:
   - Increased modal dimensions from 95% to 98% of viewport width and height:
     ```css
     max-w-[98vw] w-[98vw] h-[98vh]
     ```
   - This provides nearly fullscreen experience while maintaining a small border

2. **Improved Code Block Scrolling**:
   - Added vertical scrolling to all code blocks with `overflow-y-auto`
   - Set maximum height for code blocks to ensure they don't overflow:
     ```css
     max-h-[70vh]
     ```
   - Maintained horizontal scrolling with `overflow-x-auto`

3. **Optimized Layout Proportions**:
   - Reduced file tree width from 1/4 to 1/5 of the modal width
   - This provides more space for the actual code diff display
   - Maintained all other spacing and padding for visual consistency

## Expected Results
- Users can now view the diff modal in a nearly fullscreen experience
- Long files can be scrolled vertically within their containers
- Code blocks have independent scrolling, separate from the modal itself
- Improved overall usability for comparing large code changes

## Testing
1. Make changes to plugin code and create a new version
2. Click the "View Changes" button to open the diff modal
3. Verify the modal now fills almost the entire screen
4. Select a file with many lines of code
5. Confirm vertical scrolling works within the code blocks
6. Verify horizontal scrolling still works for long lines
7. Test both split view and unified view modes

# Code Cleanup Improvements - June 24, 2024

## Issue Identified
- Generated code sometimes contained artifacts like ellipses (`...`), placeholder comments, and strange quotation marks
- These artifacts could cause PHP syntax errors and break WordPress sites
- Code wasn't consistently formatted according to WordPress coding standards

## Analysis
- AI models sometimes include placeholders or markers in generated code
- The code generation process wasn't cleaning up these artifacts
- No standardized formatting was being applied to ensure WordPress coding standards

## Changes Made
1. **Created Code Cleanup Utility**:
   - Added a new utility file `src/lib/code-cleanup.ts` with specialized functions
   - Implemented comprehensive regex patterns to identify and remove problematic artifacts
   - Added WordPress-specific formatting rules

2. **Implemented Artifact Removal**:
   - Added cleanup for ellipses and placeholder comments:
     ```typescript
     // Remove standalone ellipses (common AI placeholder)
     .replace(/^\s*\.\.\.\s*$/gm, '')
     .replace(/^\s*\/\/\s*\.\.\.\s*$/gm, '')
     .replace(/^\s*\/\*\s*\.\.\.\s*\*\/\s*$/gm, '')
     
     // Remove "existing code" placeholder comments
     .replace(/^\s*\/\/\s*\.\.\.?\s*existing\s*code\s*\.\.\.?\s*$/gim, '')
     ```
   - Fixed quotation mark issues:
     ```typescript
     // Remove strange quotation marks that might break code
     .replace(/[""]/g, '"')
     .replace(/['']/g, "'")
     ```

3. **Added WordPress Formatting**:
   - Implemented WordPress coding standards formatting:
     ```typescript
     // Ensure proper spacing for function declarations
     .replace(/function\s+([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\s*\(/g, 'function $1(')
     
     // Ensure proper spacing for control structures
     .replace(/if\s*\(/g, 'if (')
     .replace(/}\s*else\s*{/g, '} else {')
     .replace(/}\s*else\s+if\s*\(/g, '} elseif (')
     ```
   - Added proper indentation and spacing rules

4. **Integrated with Code Generation Process**:
   - Updated `parseAIResponse` function to use the new cleanup utilities
   - Applied cleanup to all generated code components
   - Ensured consistent formatting across all plugin files

## Expected Results
- Generated code will be free of artifacts that could cause syntax errors
- Code will follow WordPress coding standards for better compatibility
- No more ellipses, placeholder comments, or strange quotation marks in the output
- More professional and consistent code quality

## Testing
1. Generate a new plugin with complex requirements
2. Verify the generated code is free of artifacts like ellipses
3. Check that the code follows WordPress coding standards
4. Test the plugin in a WordPress environment to ensure it works without errors
5. Make revisions to the plugin and verify the updated code remains clean
