### Analysis
- Port configuration in next.config.js needs to be updated
- Both serverRuntimeConfig.port and env.PORT need to be changed
- Consistent port usage is essential for proper resource loading

### Changes Made
1. Updated next.config.js to explicitly set port 3000:
   ```js
   // next.config.js
   module.exports = {
     reactStrictMode: true,
     eslint: {
       ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
     },
     typescript: {
       ignoreBuildErrors: true,
     },
     // Set explicit port to avoid conflicts
     serverRuntimeConfig: {
       port: 3000
     },
     // Ensure consistent port usage in development
     env: {
       PORT: 3000
     }
   };
   ```

2. Documentation updates:
   - Updated development-log.txt with port configuration changes
   - Added entry to dev-history.md

## [2024-05-25] Port Conflict and Resource Loading Issues

### Issue
- Application running on port 3002 but browser trying to access resources on port 3001
- ChunkLoadError: Loading chunk app-client-internals failed
- Module not found: Can't resolve 'encoding' in node-fetch/lib
- Multiple renderers concurrently rendering the same context provider

### Analysis
- Port conflict: The server is running on port 3002 (as ports 3000 and 3001 were already in use)
- Browser is attempting to load resources from incorrect port (3001)
- Missing 'encoding' dependency for node-fetch which is used by OpenAI package
- Hydration errors occurring due to client/server mismatch

### Required Actions
1. Install missing 'encoding' dependency:
   ```bash
   npm install encoding
   ```
2. Clear Next.js cache and rebuild:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. Ensure consistent port usage by explicitly setting port in next.config.js:
   ```js
   // next.config.js
   module.exports = {
     reactStrictMode: true,
     eslint: {
       ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
     },
     typescript: {
       ignoreBuildErrors: true,
     },
     // Set explicit port to avoid conflicts
     serverRuntimeConfig: {
       port: 3002
     },
     // Ensure consistent port usage in development
     env: {
       PORT: 3002
     }
   };
   ```
4. Restart the development server with clean cache

### Solution Implemented
1. Updated next.config.js to explicitly set port 3002:
   - Added serverRuntimeConfig with port: 3002
   - Added env with PORT: 3002 to ensure consistent port usage
   - Maintained existing configuration settings

2. Added encoding dependency:
   ```bash
   npm install encoding
   ```

3. Cleared Next.js cache and rebuilt the application:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   npm run build
   ```

4. Restarted the development server with the new configuration:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Results
- Application now consistently uses port 3002 for both server and client
- Resources are loaded from the correct port
- No more ChunkLoadError or hydration issues
- Resolved module resolution error for 'encoding' dependency
- Application running without console errors

### Next Steps
- Monitor for any remaining port-related issues

    // Project-specific namespace prefix
    $prefix = 'PluginName\\';
    
    // Base directory for the namespace prefix
    $base_dir = plugin_dir_path(__FILE__);
    
    // Does the class use the namespace prefix?
    $len = strlen($prefix);
    if (strncmp($prefix, $class, $len) !== 0) {
        return;
    }
    
    // Get the relative class name
    $relative_class = substr($class, $len);
    
    // Replace the namespace prefix with the base directory
    $file = $base_dir . str_replace('\\', '/', $relative_class) . '.php';
    
    // If the file exists, require it
    if (file_exists($file)) {
        require $file;
    }
});
```

**Security Implementation:**
```php
// Add nonce for AJAX requests
wp_localize_script(

        id mediumint(9) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
        time datetime DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        name tinytext NOT NULL,
        text text NOT NULL,
        url varchar(55) DEFAULT '' NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY  (id)
    ) $charset_collate;";

    require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php');
    dbDelta($sql);
}
``` 

## [2024-05-25] UI Layout and Usability Improvements

### Issue
- Current layout has suboptimal column widths (40%/20%/40%)
- File explorer takes up too much space relative to its importance
- Plugin discussion title is redundant and takes up valuable space
- Input placeholder text is not context-aware

### Analysis
- Left and right columns need more space for content (code and discussion)
- Middle file explorer column can be narrower while remaining functional
- Visual separation between columns can be improved
- Input placeholder should adapt based on user interaction stage

### Changes Made
1. Updated Column Layout in src/app/page.tsx:
   ```jsx
   {/* Left Column - Chat Interface (45%) */}
   <div className="w-[45%] flex flex-col min-h-0 border-r">
     {/* ... */}
   </div>

   {/* Center Column - File Explorer (10%) */}
   <div className="w-[10%] border-r flex flex-col min-h-0 bg-gray-50">
     {/* ... */}
   </div>

   {/* Right Column - Code Display (45%) */}
   <div className="w-[45%] flex flex-col min-h-0">
     {/* ... */}
   </div>
   ```

2. Enhanced Plugin Discussion Component in src/components/plugin-discussion.tsx:
   - Added state tracking for initial message:
     ```jsx
     const [isInitialMessage, setIsInitialMessage] = useState(true)
     ```
   - Updated placeholder text to be context-aware:
     ```jsx
     placeholder={isInitialMessage ? "Describe your plugin..." : "Request updates to your plugin..."}
     ```
   - Removed redundant title:
     ```jsx
     {/* Removed: <div className="text-2xl font-bold pl-5 pt-5">Plugin Discussion and Change</div> */}
     ```
   - Reduced top margin for better space utilization:
     ```jsx
     <div style={{ marginTop: "20px" }} className="mb-4 px-5">
     ```
   - Updated state after first message submission:
     ```jsx
     setIsInitialMessage(false)
     ```

### Expected Results
- More balanced layout with appropriate space allocation
- Better visual separation between columns
- Cleaner interface without redundant elements
- More intuitive user experience with context-aware placeholder text

### Next Steps
- Monitor user feedback on the new layout
- Consider additional UI improvements for better workflow
- Evaluate if further adjustments to column widths are needed

## [2024-05-26] UI Refinements and Usability Enhancements

### Issue
- Placeholder text not changing after initial message submission
- Redundant 'Add Details' button showing alongside 'Start' button
- Unnecessary 'Preview' button taking up space in the code display section

### Analysis
- The placeholder text in the PluginDiscussion component was using a state variable that wasn't properly updated
- The 'Add Details' button is redundant since clicking 'Start' shows the plugin details modal anyway
- The 'Preview' button is not needed according to user requirements

### Changes Made
1. Fixed placeholder text in PluginDiscussion component:
   ```jsx
   // Changed from using a state variable:
   const [isInitialMessage, setIsInitialMessage] = useState(true)
   
   // To using a derived value based on messages array:
   const isInitialMessage = messages.length === 0
   ```
   - This ensures the placeholder text automatically changes from "Describe your plugin..." to "Request updates to your plugin..." after the first message is sent

2. Improved button display in the main interface:
   - Removed the 'Add Details' button when no plugin details have been filled
   - Only show 'Edit Details' button after plugin details have been filled
   - Removed the 'Preview' button from the code display section
   - Kept the 'Revise' button for requesting specific changes to the plugin

### Expected Results
- More intuitive placeholder text that changes based on conversation state
- Cleaner UI with fewer redundant buttons
- Better user flow with the 'Start' button handling initial plugin details
- Maintained ability to edit plugin details after initial setup

### Next Steps
- Monitor user feedback on the streamlined interface
- Consider additional UI improvements for better workflow
- Evaluate if further button consolidation is needed

## Layout Improvements and Validation Modal
**Date**: June 17, 2023

### Issue Identified
The application needed several UI improvements to enhance usability:
1. The file explorer section was too narrow at 10% width, making it difficult to read file names
2. The version control dropdown was located at the bottom of the file explorer, making it less accessible
3. The START button lacked proper validation when no description or file was provided

### Changes Made
1. **Updated Column Layout**:
   - Changed left column (chat interface) from 45% to 40% width
   - Increased center column (file explorer) from 10% to 15% width
   - Maintained right column (code display) at 45% width

2. **Improved Version Control Accessibility**:
   - Moved the version control dropdown from the bottom to the top of the file explorer
   - Placed it directly under the "Files" heading for better visibility
   - Maintained the same functionality and styling

3. **Added Validation Modal for START Button**:
   - Created a new modal dialog that appears when the START button is clicked without a description or file
   - Designed with a clean white background and centered text
   - Added a green "I understand" button for dismissal
   - Improved user experience by providing clear guidance on required actions

### Implementation Details
- Modified column width classes in the main layout
- Restructured the file explorer component to place the version control at the top
- Added a new state variable `showValidationModal` to control the validation modal
- Updated the `generateCode` function to show the modal instead of setting an error message
- Created a styled Dialog component with centered content and a green button

### Next Steps
- Monitor user feedback on the new layout proportions
- Consider additional UI improvements for better workflow
- Evaluate if further adjustments to the validation flow are needed

## [2024-06-19] Fixed Build Errors and JSX Syntax Issues

- Incorrect localStorage handling for generatedCode (storing PHP code as JSON)

### Analysis
- The build error was caused by a missing closing tag for the `TooltipProvider` component
- The localStorage handling was incorrectly using JSON.stringify for the generatedCode, which caused parsing errors
- The generatedPlugin state was also being stored incorrectly in localStorage

### Changes Made
1. Fixed the missing closing tag for the `TooltipProvider` component:
   ```jsx
   <TooltipProvider>
     <Tooltip>
       <TooltipTrigger asChild>
         <Button
           onClick={() => setShowRevisionModal(true)}
           className="bg-emerald-600 hover:bg-emerald-700 text-white"
         >
           Revise
         </Button>
       </TooltipTrigger>
       <TooltipContent>
         <p>Request specific changes to your plugin</p>
       </TooltipContent>
     </Tooltip>
   </TooltipProvider>
   ```

2. Improved localStorage handling:
   - Changed from `localStorage.setItem("generatedCode", JSON.stringify(generatedCode))` to `localStorage.setItem("generatedCode", generatedCode)`
   - Changed from `localStorage.setItem("generatedPlugin", JSON.stringify(generatedPlugin))` to `localStorage.setItem("generatedPlugin", String(generatedPlugin))`
   - This prevents trying to parse PHP code as JSON and ensures proper type handling

### Next Steps
- Verify the application builds and runs without errors
- Test the localStorage functionality to ensure it correctly saves and loads state
- Monitor for any other JSX syntax issues or localStorage-related problems

## [2024-06-19] Fixed Button Visibility and Behavior

### Issues Identified
- The START button was disappearing after 1 second due to a JSON parsing error
- The START button needed to be light green initially, then solid green when description/files are added
- The START button should disappear permanently after plugin generation
- The EDIT DETAILS button was incorrectly showing before plugin generation

### Analysis
- The JSON parsing error was caused by trying to parse PHP code as JSON from localStorage
- The button visibility logic needed to be tied to the `generatedPlugin` state
- The localStorage handling for `generatedPlugin` needed to be simplified

### Changes Made
1. Fixed localStorage handling:
   - Removed JSON.parse() for the generatedCode
   - Simplified generatedPlugin state setting with direct comparison: `if (savedGeneratedPlugin === "true")`
   - Added proper localStorage setting: `localStorage.setItem("generatedPlugin", "true")`

2. Improved START button behavior:
   - Light green (bg-emerald-200) when no description or files are present
   - Solid green (bg-emerald-600) when description or files are added
   - Only visible when `generatedPlugin` is false
   - Completely hidden after plugin generation

3. Fixed EDIT DETAILS button visibility:
   - Only visible when both `hasFilledDetails` AND `generatedPlugin` are true
   - Completely hidden before plugin generation
   - Updated icon to Settings2 for better visual clarity

### Implementation Details
```jsx
// Button visibility logic
{/* EDIT DETAILS Button - Only show after plugin generation */}
{hasFilledDetails && generatedPlugin && (
  <TooltipProvider>
    <Tooltip>
      <TooltipTrigger asChild>
        <Button
          onClick={() => setShowPluginDetailsModal(true)}
          variant="outline"
          size="sm"
        >
          <Settings2 className="h-4 w-4 mr-1" />
          Edit Details
        </Button>
      </TooltipTrigger>
      <TooltipContent>
        <p>Edit plugin details</p>
      </TooltipContent>
    </Tooltip>
  </TooltipProvider>
)}

{/* START Button - Only show before plugin generation */}
{!generatedPlugin && (
  <TooltipProvider>
    <Tooltip>
      <TooltipTrigger asChild>
        <Button
          onClick={() => {
            if (!hasFilledDetails) {
              setShowPluginDetailsModal(true)
            } else {
              generateCode()
            }
          }}
          disabled={loading || isCreatingPreview}
          className={
            !description && attachedFiles.length === 0
              ? "bg-emerald-200 hover:bg-emerald-300 text-emerald-800"
              : "bg-emerald-600 hover:bg-emerald-700 text-white"
          }
        >
          {loading ? (
            <>
              <RefreshCw className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
            </>
          ) : (
            "Start"
          )}
        </Button>
      </TooltipTrigger>
      <TooltipContent>
        <p>
          {!description && attachedFiles.length === 0
            ? "Please add a description or attach files first"
            : "Generate your WordPress plugin"}
        </p>
      </TooltipContent>
    </Tooltip>
  </TooltipProvider>
)}
```

### Next Steps
- Verify the START button remains visible on initial load
- Ensure the button color changes correctly based on user input
- Confirm the EDIT DETAILS button only appears after plugin generation
- Monitor for any other localStorage-related issues

## [2024-06-19] Fixed START Button Disappearing Issue

### Issues Identified
- The START button was disappearing after 1 second of page load
- The issue was caused by improper localStorage handling for the `generatedPlugin` state
- The button visibility was incorrectly toggled due to state initialization problems

### Analysis
- The `generatedPlugin` state was being initialized as `false` but then immediately overwritten by the useEffect hook
- The localStorage handling was inconsistent, with some places directly setting localStorage and others relying on the useEffect
- There was no protection against state changes during the initial render

### Changes Made
1. Improved state initialization:
   - Changed from basic `useState(false)` to a function-based initialization that reads from localStorage
   - Added error handling to prevent crashes if localStorage access fails
   - Added debug logging to track state changes

2. Enhanced localStorage handling:
   - Removed redundant localStorage.setItem calls in various functions
   - Centralized all localStorage updates in a single useEffect
   - Added a ref to track initial render and prevent unnecessary localStorage updates

3. Added validation in the generateCode function:
   - Added explicit checks for description, attachedFiles, and hasFilledDetails
   - Shows validation modal when needed instead of silently failing

### Implementation Details
```jsx
// Function-based state initialization
const [generatedPlugin, setGeneratedPlugin] = useState(() => {
  try {
    const savedValue = localStorage.getItem("generatedPlugin")
    console.log("Initial generatedPlugin value from localStorage:", savedValue)
    return savedValue === "true"
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Error reading generatedPlugin from localStorage:", e)
    return false
  }
})

// Added ref to track initial render
const isInitialRender = useRef(true)

// Enhanced useEffect with initial render protection
useEffect(() => {
  // Skip the first render to prevent overriding localStorage values during initialization
  if (isInitialRender.current) {
    isInitialRender.current = false
    return
  }
  
  // Log the current state before saving to localStorage
  console.log("Saving generatedPlugin to localStorage:", generatedPlugin)
  localStorage.setItem("generatedPlugin", String(generatedPlugin))
}, [messages, codeVersions, pluginDetails, generatedCode, generatedPlugin])
```

### Next Steps
- Monitor the START button behavior to ensure it remains visible until plugin generation
- Verify that the button state persists correctly across page refreshes
- Consider adding additional validation to prevent accidental state changes
- Review other localStorage handling in the application for similar issues

## [2024-06-20] Fixed React Hydration Error

### Issues Identified
- React hydration error: "Expected server HTML to contain a matching <input> in <div>"
- Error caused by using `localStorage` during initial render in the `useState` initialization
- This created a mismatch between server-side rendering and client-side hydration

### Analysis
- Next.js performs server-side rendering first, where `localStorage` is not available
- When the client tries to hydrate the server-rendered HTML, it finds differences due to `localStorage` access
- The specific issue was in the initialization of the `generatedPlugin` state variable
- Using browser-only APIs like `localStorage` during component initialization causes hydration mismatches

### Changes Made
1. Modified the `generatedPlugin` state initialization:
   - Changed from function-based initialization that accessed `localStorage` directly:
     ```jsx
     const [generatedPlugin, setGeneratedPlugin] = useState(() => {
       try {
         const savedValue = localStorage.getItem("generatedPlugin")
         return savedValue === "true"
       } catch (e) {
         return false
       }
     })
     ```
   - To a simple initial value with a separate useEffect:
     ```jsx
     const [generatedPlugin, setGeneratedPlugin] = useState(false)
     
     useEffect(() => {
       // This will only run on the client after hydration is complete
       try {
         const savedValue = localStorage.getItem("generatedPlugin")
         if (savedValue === "true") {
           setGeneratedPlugin(true)
         }
       } catch (e) {
         console.error("Error reading generatedPlugin from localStorage:", e)
       }
     }, [])
     ```

2. This ensures:
   - Server-side rendering uses a consistent initial state (`false`)
   - Client-side hydration matches the server-rendered HTML
   - `localStorage` is only accessed after hydration is complete

### Next Steps
- Monitor for any other hydration errors in the application
- Review other state initializations that might access browser-only APIs
- Consider implementing a more robust client-detection pattern for localStorage access
- Test the application across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior

## [2024-06-20] Fixed START Button Visibility Issue

### Issues Identified
- START button not showing up at all, even on initial page load
- localStorage handling for `generatedPlugin` state was incomplete
- No way to reset the plugin generation state if it gets stuck

### Analysis
- The `generatedPlugin` state was being set to `true` from localStorage but never explicitly set to `false` when needed
- When localStorage contained a value other than "true", the state wasn't being properly reset
- No error handling to ensure the state defaults to `false` when localStorage access fails
- No way for users to manually reset the state if it gets stuck

### Changes Made
1. Improved localStorage initialization for `generatedPlugin`:
   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     try {
       const savedValue = localStorage.getItem("generatedPlugin")
       if (savedValue === "true") {
         setGeneratedPlugin(true)
       } else {
         // Explicitly set to false if not "true" to ensure button visibility
         setGeneratedPlugin(false)
         // Clear any potentially corrupted value
         localStorage.removeItem("generatedPlugin")
       }
     } catch (e) {
       console.error("Error reading generatedPlugin from localStorage:", e)
       // Ensure generatedPlugin is false if there's an error
       setGeneratedPlugin(false)
     }
   }, [])
   ```

2. Added a debug button to manually reset the plugin generation state:
   ```jsx
   <Button
     onClick={() => {
       setGeneratedPlugin(false);
       localStorage.removeItem("generatedPlugin");
       console.log("Reset generatedPlugin state to false");
     }}
     variant="outline"
     size="sm"
     className="bg-red-100 hover:bg-red-200 text-red-800"
   >
     Reset Plugin State
   </Button>
   ```

### Next Steps
- Verify the START button now appears on initial page load
- Test the Reset Plugin State button to ensure it properly resets the state
- Consider adding more comprehensive state management for all localStorage values
- Monitor for any other issues related to button visibility or state persistence

## [2024-06-20] UI Improvements - Button Behavior and Visibility

### Issues Identified
- RESET PLUGIN STATE button was taking up unnecessary space in the UI
- START button behavior was inconsistent, sometimes skipping the plugin details modal
- REVISE button in the top right corner was redundant and not needed

### Analysis
- The RESET PLUGIN STATE button was added for debugging but is no longer needed
- The START button should always show the plugin details modal
- The REVISE button functionality is already available through the chat interface

### Changes Made
1. Removed the RESET PLUGIN STATE button:
   ```jsx
   // Removed the entire TooltipProvider component containing the Reset Plugin State button
   ```

2. Modified the START button to always show the plugin details modal:
   ```jsx
   <Button
     onClick={() => {
       setShowPluginDetailsModal(true)
     }}
     disabled={loading || isCreatingPreview}
     className={
       !description && attachedFiles.length === 0
         ? "bg-emerald-200 hover:bg-emerald-300 text-emerald-800"
         : "bg-emerald-600 hover:bg-emerald-700 text-white"
     }
   >
     {loading ? (
       <>
         <RefreshCw className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
       </>
     ) : (
       "Start"
     )}
   </Button>
   ```

3. Updated the PluginDetailsModal onSubmit handler to automatically generate code:
   ```jsx
   onSubmit={(details) => {
     setPluginDetails(details)
     setPluginName(details.name)
     setHasFilledDetails(true)
     setShowPluginDetailsModal(false)
     
     // Generate code if we have a description or files
     if (description || attachedFiles.length > 0) {
       generateCode()
     }
   }}
   ```

4. Removed the REVISE button from the top right corner:
   ```jsx
   // Removed the entire section containing the REVISE button
   ```

### Next Steps
- Verify the START button correctly shows the plugin details modal
- Ensure code generation happens automatically after filling in plugin details
- Monitor user feedback on the streamlined interface

## [2024-06-20] Fixed Caching Issues and Validation Modal

### Issues Identified
- The app was holding cache from previous sessions, particularly on Vercel deployments
- The START button wasn't showing the validation modal when clicked with no description or files
- Users needed a way to force a new session and clear localStorage

### Analysis
- The localStorage persistence was causing state to be carried over between sessions
- The START button was modified to always show the plugin details modal, bypassing the validation check
- There was no easy way for users to clear their session data and start fresh

### Changes Made
1. Added URL parameter support to force a new session:
   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     // Check for force_new_session parameter in URL
     const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
     const forceNewSession = urlParams.get('force_new_session') === 'true';
     
     // Clear all localStorage if force_new_session is true
     if (forceNewSession) {
       console.log("Forcing new session, clearing localStorage");
       localStorage.clear();
       // Redirect to clean URL without the parameter
       window.history.replaceState({}, document.title, window.location.pathname);
       return; // Skip loading from localStorage
     }
     
     // Existing localStorage loading code...
   }, [])
   ```

2. Added a "New Session" button in the header:
   ```jsx
   <div className="flex justify-between items-center p-4 border-b flex-shrink-0">
     <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">WordPress Plugin Generator</h1>
     <Button
       onClick={() => {
         // Clear localStorage and reload with force_new_session parameter
         localStorage.clear();
         window.location.href = window.location.pathname + '?force_new_session=true';
       }}
       variant="outline"
       size="sm"
     >
       New Session
     </Button>
   </div>
   ```

3. Fixed the START button to show the validation modal when needed:
   ```jsx
   <Button
     onClick={() => {
       if (!description && attachedFiles.length === 0) {
         setShowValidationModal(true)
       } else {
         setShowPluginDetailsModal(true)
       }
     }}
     disabled={loading || isCreatingPreview}
     className={
       !description && attachedFiles.length === 0
         ? "bg-emerald-200 hover:bg-emerald-300 text-emerald-800"
         : "bg-emerald-600 hover:bg-emerald-700 text-white"
     }
   >
     {loading ? (
       <>
         <RefreshCw className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
       </>
     ) : (
       "Start"
     )}
   </Button>
   ```

### Next Steps
- Test the app on Vercel to ensure the caching issue is resolved
- Verify the validation modal appears when clicking START with no description or files
- Monitor user feedback on the new session management features

## [2024-06-20] Validation Modal Styling Improvements

### Issues Identified
- The validation modal heading needed to be better centered
- The "I understand" button was green instead of the requested black color

### Analysis
- The modal title had `text-center` on the parent container but needed it directly on the title element
- The button was using green styling (`bg-green-600`) but black was preferred for the design

### Changes Made
1. Improved title centering by adding `text-center` class directly to the DialogTitle:
   ```jsx
   <DialogTitle className="text-xl text-center">Action Required</DialogTitle>
   ```

2. Changed the button color from green to black:
   ```jsx
   <Button 
     onClick={() => setShowValidationModal(false)} 
     className="bg-black hover:bg-gray-800 text-white"
   >
     I understand
   </Button>
   ```

### Next Steps
- Verify the modal appears with proper styling when clicking START with no description or files
- Ensure the button hover state works correctly with the new black background

## [2024-06-20] Validation Modal Button Centering

### Issues Identified
- The "I understand" button in the validation modal needed to be centered

### Analysis
- The button was inside a `DialogFooter` component which doesn't center its content by default
- Replacing the `DialogFooter` with a simple `div` with flex centering would provide better control

### Changes Made
1. Replaced the `DialogFooter` with a centered `div`:
   ```jsx
   // Before
   <DialogFooter className="flex justify-center mt-4">
     <Button 
       onClick={() => setShowValidationModal(false)} 
       className="bg-black hover:bg-gray-800 text-white"
     >
       I understand
     </Button>
   </DialogFooter>

   // After
   <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
     <Button 
       onClick={() => setShowValidationModal(false)} 
       className="bg-black hover:bg-gray-800 text-white"
     >
       I understand
     </Button>
   </div>
   ```

### Next Steps
- Verify the button is properly centered in the validation modal
- Test the modal on different screen sizes to ensure consistent centering

## [2024-06-20] Implemented Automatic Cache Clearing on Page Load

### Issues Identified
- The application was retaining data from previous sessions when loaded
- Users were seeing details from previous plugin sessions
- Manual cache clearing was required using the "New Session" button

### Analysis
- The app was using localStorage to persist state between sessions
- While the "New Session" button existed, it required manual intervention
- Users expected a fresh session each time they loaded the application
- The existing code only cleared localStorage when the "force_new_session" URL parameter was present

### Changes Made
1. Modified the initialization useEffect to automatically clear localStorage on every page load:
   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     // Auto-clear localStorage on first load of the app
     // This ensures each page load starts with a fresh session
     localStorage.clear();
     console.log("Auto-clearing localStorage on page load for a fresh session");
     
     // Rest of the existing code...
   }, [])
   ```

2. Added comments to explain the behavior:
   - Clarified that localStorage is automatically cleared on page load
   - Noted that this ensures a fresh session for each visit
   - Maintained the existing "force_new_session" parameter logic for compatibility

### Expected Results
- Each time the application loads, it will start with a completely fresh session
- No previous plugin details, code, or messages will be retained
- Users will always see a clean state when they open the application
- The "New Session" button remains available for mid-session resets

### Next Steps
- Monitor user feedback to ensure this behavior meets expectations
- Consider adding a toggle or setting if some users prefer persistent sessions
- Test across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior

## [2024-06-20] Fixed Plugin Generation After Details Submission

### Issues Identified
- Plugin wasn't generating after the first time entering plugin details
- Users had to click "Start" and enter plugin details twice before generation would occur
- The issue was causing confusion and disrupting the expected workflow

### Analysis
- The `generateCode` function contained duplicate validation checks
- After setting `loading` and clearing errors, the function was performing the same validation checks again
- This caused the function to exit early even when all conditions were met

### Changes Made
1. Removed the duplicate validation checks in the `generateCode` function:
   ```jsx
   const generateCode = async () => {
     // Initial validation checks (kept these)
     if (!description && attachedFiles.length === 0) {
       setShowValidationModal(true)
       return
     }

     if (!hasFilledDetails) {
       setShowPluginDetailsModal(true)
       return
     }

     if (!pluginDetails) {
       setError("Please fill in plugin details first")
       return
     }

     setLoading(true)
     setError(null)
     setIsStreaming(false)

     try {
       // Removed duplicate validation checks that were here
       // The checks above are sufficient

       let fullRequest = description
       // Rest of the function...
   ```

2. Simplified the flow to ensure that once validation passes, the code generation proceeds without interruption

### Expected Results
- Plugin will generate immediately after entering plugin details the first time
- Users will no longer need to click "Start" and enter details twice
- The workflow will be more intuitive and efficient

### Next Steps
- Verify that plugin generation works correctly after entering details
- Monitor for any other unexpected behavior in the generation process
- Consider adding more detailed logging to track the flow of the generation process

## [2024-06-21] Fixed Plugin Details Modal Persistence Issue

### Issue
- Users had to enter plugin details twice
- The plugin details modal was clearing form data after submission
- localStorage was being cleared on every page load, losing saved plugin details

### Analysis
- The PluginDetailsModal component was resetting form data after submission
- The useEffect hook in page.tsx was clearing localStorage on every page load
- These issues combined forced users to enter plugin details multiple times

### Changes Made
1. Modified PluginDetailsModal component to persist form data:
   - Removed code that reset form data after submission
   - Removed code that reset form data when closing the modal

2. Modified localStorage handling in page.tsx:
   - Removed automatic localStorage clearing on page load
   - Only clear localStorage when force_new_session parameter is present
   - Improved loading of saved data from localStorage

### Expected Behavior
- Users should only need to enter plugin details once
- Form data should persist between modal openings
- Plugin generation should proceed immediately after submitting details

### Testing
- Verify that plugin details only need to be entered once
- Verify that plugin generation proceeds immediately after submitting details
- Verify that plugin details persist between page refreshes

## [2024-06-22] Fixed Caching and Double-Click Issues

### Issues Identified
- Application was retaining session data between page refreshes
- Users had to click CONTINUE twice on the plugin details form to generate the plugin
- These issues were causing confusion and disrupting the expected workflow

### Analysis
- The localStorage persistence was causing state to be carried over between sessions
- The setTimeout in the PluginDetailsModal onSubmit handler was causing the need for a second click

### Changes Made
1. Modified localStorage handling:
   - Added automatic localStorage clearing on every page refresh
   - This ensures a completely fresh session each time the page is loaded
   - Prevents any previous plugin details, code, or messages from being retained

2. Fixed the double-click issue in the PluginDetailsModal:
   - Removed the setTimeout in the onSubmit handler
   - Now calling generateCode directly after setting the plugin details
   - This ensures the plugin generation happens immediately after submitting the form

### Expected Results
- Each page refresh will start with a completely fresh session
- No previous plugin details, code, or messages will be retained
- Plugin will generate immediately after clicking CONTINUE in the plugin details form
- Users will no longer need to click CONTINUE twice

### Testing
- Verify that refreshing the page clears all session data
- Verify that plugin generation works correctly after a single click on CONTINUE
- Monitor for any other unexpected behavior in the generation process

## [2024-06-22] Fixed Double-Click Issue with START Button

### Issue Identified
- Users had to click the START button twice to generate a plugin
- After filling in plugin details and clicking CONTINUE, users still had to click START again
- This created a confusing user experience and unnecessary extra steps

### Analysis
- The START button click handler wasn't checking if plugin details were already filled
- When hasFilledDetails was true, it should have called generateCode directly
- Instead, it was always showing the plugin details modal again

### Changes Made
- Modified the START button click handler to check if hasFilledDetails is true
- If details are already filled, it now calls generateCode directly
- This bypasses the need to show the plugin details modal a second time

```jsx
onClick={() => {
  if (!description && attachedFiles.length === 0) {
    setShowValidationModal(true)
  } else if (hasFilledDetails) {
    // If details are already filled, call generateCode directly
    generateCode();
  } else {
    setShowPluginDetailsModal(true)
  }
}}
```

### Expected Results
- After entering plugin details and clicking CONTINUE, the plugin will generate immediately
- Users will no longer need to click START a second time
- The workflow is now more intuitive and requires fewer clicks

### Testing
- Verify that plugin generation works correctly after clicking CONTINUE once
- Verify that the START button correctly bypasses the details modal when details are already filled
- Monitor for any other unexpected behavior in the generation process

## [2024-06-22] Fixed Plugin Generation After Modal Submission

### Issue Identified
- Users had to click START again after submitting the plugin details modal
- The plugin generation wasn't starting immediately after clicking CONTINUE
- This created an unnecessary extra step in the workflow

### Analysis
- The PluginDetailsModal onSubmit handler had a conditional check that was preventing immediate generation
- It was only calling generateCode if description or attachedFiles were present
- This conditional check was redundant since generateCode has its own validation

### Changes Made
- Modified the PluginDetailsModal onSubmit handler to always call generateCode:
  ```jsx
  onSubmit={(details) => {
    // Set plugin details and hasFilledDetails
    setPluginDetails(details);
    setPluginName(details.name);
    setHasFilledDetails(true);
    setShowPluginDetailsModal(false);
    
    // Always call generateCode immediately after clicking CONTINUE
    // The generateCode function has its own validation for description/files
    generateCode();
  }}
  ```
- Removed the conditional check for description or attachedFiles
- Relied on the generateCode function's built-in validation

### Expected Results
- Plugin generation starts immediately after clicking CONTINUE on the modal
- No need to click START again after submitting plugin details
- Smoother, more intuitive workflow with fewer clicks required
- The generateCode function's validation still prevents generation without proper inputs

### Testing
- Verify that plugin generation starts immediately after clicking CONTINUE
- Confirm that the validation in generateCode still works properly
- Test with and without description/files to ensure proper behavior in all scenarios

## [2024-06-22] Fixed Plugin Generation with Custom Button Class and Event Listener

### Issue Identified
- Plugin generation wasn't starting immediately after clicking CONTINUE on the plugin details modal
- Users had to click START again after submitting the plugin details
- Previous fixes were not working consistently across all scenarios

### Analysis
- The onSubmit handler in the PluginDetailsModal component wasn't reliably triggering the generateCode function
- React's event handling and state updates might be causing timing issues
- A more direct approach was needed to ensure the button click always triggers plugin generation

### Changes Made
1. Added a specific class to the CONTINUE button in the plugin details modal:
   ```jsx
   <Button 
     type="submit" 
     disabled={isSubmitting}
     className="bg-black text-white hover:bg-black/90 continue-generate-plugin-button"
   >
     {isSubmitting ? 'Processing...' : 'Continue'}
   </Button>
   ```

2. Added a global event listener to detect clicks on the CONTINUE button:
   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     // Function to handle clicks on the CONTINUE button
     const handleContinueButtonClick = (event: MouseEvent) => {
       const target = event.target as HTMLElement;
       
       // Check if the clicked element or any of its parents has the continue-generate-plugin-button class
       if (target.closest('.continue-generate-plugin-button')) {
         console.log('CONTINUE button clicked, will generate plugin');
         // Add a small delay to ensure the modal state is updated first
         setTimeout(() => {
           if (hasFilledDetails) {
             console.log('Generating plugin after CONTINUE button click');
             generateCode();
           }
         }, 100);
       }
     };

     // Add the event listener to the document
     document.addEventListener('click', handleContinueButtonClick, true);

     // Clean up the event listener when the component unmounts
     return () => {
       document.removeEventListener('click', handleContinueButtonClick, true);
     };
   }, [hasFilledDetails, generateCode]);
   ```

### Expected Results
- Plugin generation starts immediately after clicking CONTINUE on the modal
- The event listener provides a more direct and reliable way to trigger the generateCode function
- The small delay ensures that state updates have completed before attempting to generate the plugin
- Console logs provide visibility into the process for debugging

### Testing
- Verify that plugin generation starts immediately after clicking CONTINUE
- Check console logs to confirm the event listener is detecting the button click
- Test across different scenarios to ensure consistent behavior

## [2024-06-23] Improved Button Labeling and Visibility

### Issue Identified
- The START button needed to change to GENERATE after filling in plugin details
- The button needed to be removed once the code was generated
- This would provide clearer user guidance through the plugin generation workflow

### Analysis
- The START button was always labeled "Start" regardless of whether plugin details were filled
- The button visibility was already correctly set to hide after plugin generation
- The button text needed to dynamically change based on the `hasFilledDetails` state

### Changes Made
- Modified the START button to dynamically change its label based on the state:
  ```jsx
  {loading ? (
    <>
      <RefreshCw className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
    </>
  ) : (
    hasFilledDetails ? "Generate" : "Start"
  )}
  ```
- Kept the existing logic that hides the button once `generatedPlugin` is true
- Updated the comment to reflect the dual purpose of the button: `{/* START/GENERATE Button - Only show before plugin generation */}`

### Expected Results
- When the app first loads, the button will say "Start"
- After filling in plugin details, the button will change to say "Generate"
- After generating the plugin, the button will be removed entirely
- This provides clearer guidance to users about the current state of the workflow

### Testing
- Verify the button initially shows "Start"
- After filling in plugin details and clicking CONTINUE, verify the button shows "Generate" if visible
- After generating the plugin, verify the button is removed from the UI

## [2024-06-23] Version Control Dropdown Background Update

### Issue Identified
- The version control dropdown had a transparent background
- This made it difficult to read the dropdown contents against different backgrounds
- A solid white background was needed for better visibility and consistency

### Analysis
- The SelectTrigger and SelectContent components needed the bg-white class added
- This would ensure a consistent white background for both the dropdown trigger and its content
- The change would improve readability and match the design of other UI elements

### Changes Made
- Added bg-white class to the SelectTrigger component:
  ```jsx
  <SelectTrigger className="h-8 text-xs bg-white">
    <SelectValue placeholder="Select version" />
  </SelectTrigger>
  ```
- Added bg-white class to the SelectContent component:
  ```jsx
  <SelectContent className="bg-white">
    {codeVersions.map((version, index) => (
      <SelectItem key={version.id} value={index.toString()}>
        {version.version} ({new Date(version.timestamp).toLocaleString()})
      </SelectItem>
    ))}
  </SelectContent>
  ```

### Expected Results
- The version control dropdown now has a solid white background
- Improved readability of dropdown contents
- Consistent appearance with other UI elements
- Better visual contrast against any background

### Testing
- Verify the dropdown trigger has a solid white background
- Verify the dropdown content has a solid white background when opened
- Check that text is clearly visible against the white background

## [2024-06-23] Implementing Revision History Visualization

### Issue Identified
The plugin generator needed a way to visualize changes between different versions of the code, showing which files were modified and what lines were added or deleted.

### Analysis
To implement this feature, we needed to:
1. Enhance the `CodeVersion` interface to track file-specific changes
2. Create utility functions to generate diffs between file versions
3. Modify the `FileExplorer` component to show change indicators
4. Create a modal component to display detailed file diffs
5. Update the main page component to integrate these features

### Changes Made

1. Enhanced the `CodeVersion` interface in `src/types/shared.ts`:
```typescript
export interface CodeVersion {
  id: string
  version: string
  code: string
  description: string
  timestamp: string
  fileChanges?: FileChange[]
}

export interface FileChange {
  path: string
  added: number
  deleted: number
  content: string
  previousContent?: string
}
```

2. Created a new utility file `src/lib/diff-utils.ts` with functions to generate diffs:
```typescript
export function generateFileChanges(
  oldStructure: FileStructure[] | null,
  newStructure: FileStructure[]
): FileChange[] {
  // Implementation to compare file structures and generate changes
}

export function generateLineDiff(oldText: string, newText: string): { type: 'added' | 'deleted' | 'unchanged', content: string }[] {
  // Implementation to generate line-by-line diffs
}
```

3. Modified the `addCodeVersion` function to track file changes:
```typescript
const addCodeVersion = (code: string, description: string = '', versionNumber?: string) => {
  // Generate file structure for the new code
  const newStructure = parseCodeToFileStructure(code)
  
  // Get the previous file structure
  const previousStructure = codeVersions.length > 0 ? parseCodeToFileStructure(codeVersions[codeVersions.length - 1].code) : null
  
  // Generate file changes
  const fileChanges = generateFileChanges(previousStructure, newStructure)
  
  const versionEntry: CodeVersion = {
    // Existing properties
    fileChanges
  }
  // Rest of the function
}
```

4. Updated the `FileExplorer` component to show change indicators:
```typescript
interface FileExplorerProps {
  // Existing props
  fileChanges?: FileChange[]
  onViewChanges?: (path: string) => void
}

// Added indicators for added/deleted lines and a "View" button for changes
```

5. Created a new `DiffViewModal` component to display detailed file diffs:
```typescript
export function DiffViewModal({
  isOpen,
  onClose,
  fileChanges,
  versionDescription,
  versionNumber
}: DiffViewModalProps) {
  // Implementation with split view and unified view tabs
}
```

6. Updated the main page component to integrate the diff view:
```typescript
// Added state for diff modal
const [showDiffModal, setShowDiffModal] = useState(false)
const [selectedVersionForDiff, setSelectedVersionForDiff] = useState<string | null>(null)
const [selectedFileForDiff, setSelectedFileForDiff] = useState<string | null>(null)

// Added handlers for viewing changes
const handleViewFileChanges = (filePath: string) => {
  setSelectedFileForDiff(filePath)
  setShowDiffModal(true)
}

// Updated FileExplorer with new props
<FileExplorer
  // Existing props
  fileChanges={currentVersionFileChanges}
  onViewChanges={handleViewFileChanges}
/>

// Added DiffViewModal to the component
```

### Expected Results
- Users can see indicators in the file explorer showing which files have been modified
- Users can click on a "View" button to see detailed changes for a specific file
- The diff view shows both a split view (old vs new) and a unified view with line-by-line changes
- Changes are tracked automatically when new versions are created

### Testing
1. Generate a plugin
2. Make changes to the plugin code
3. Create a new version
4. Verify that change indicators appear in the file explorer
5. Click on the eye icon to open the diff modal
6. Test both split view and unified view
7. Verify that line additions and deletions are correctly highlighted

## [2024-06-23] Enhancing Revision History Visualization

### Issue Identified
The initial implementation of the revision history visualization feature needed enhancements to provide a more intuitive user experience. Specifically, we needed to replace the "View" text button with an eye icon and add strikethrough styling for deleted lines.

### Analysis
To enhance the feature, we needed to:
1. Replace the "View" text button with an eye icon in the `FileExplorer` component
2. Add strikethrough styling for deleted lines in the `DiffViewModal`
3. Implement a more robust `parseCodeToFileStructure` function to properly parse code into a file structure

### Changes Made

1. Updated the `FileExplorer` component to use an eye icon instead of text:
```typescript
{onViewChanges && (
  <TooltipProvider>
    <Tooltip>
      <TooltipTrigger asChild>
        <button 
          className="ml-1 text-xs text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800"
          onClick={(e) => {
            e.stopPropagation()
            onViewChanges(fullPath)
          }}
        >
          <Eye className="h-3.5 w-3.5" />
        </button>
      </TooltipTrigger>
      <TooltipContent>
        <p>View file changes</p>
      </TooltipContent>
    </Tooltip>
  </TooltipProvider>
)}
```

2. Enhanced the `DiffViewModal` to add strikethrough for deleted lines:
```typescript
<div 
  key={i} 
  className={cn(
    "whitespace-pre-wrap py-0.5",
    line.type === 'added' && "bg-green-50 text-green-800",
    line.type === 'deleted' && "bg-red-50 text-red-800 line-through opacity-70"
  )}
>
```

3. Implemented a robust `parseCodeToFileStructure` function:
```typescript
const parseCodeToFileStructure = (code: string): FileStructure[] => {
  // Implementation that parses code with file markers
  // and creates a proper file structure
}
```

4. Added helper functions to manage the file structure:
```typescript
const updateFileInStructure = (structure: FileStructure[], filePath: string, content: string) => {
  // Implementation to update a file in the structure
}

const addFileToStructure = (structure: FileStructure[], filePath: string, content: string) => {
  // Implementation to add a file to the structure
}
```

### Expected Results
- The file explorer now shows an eye icon instead of "View" text, providing a more intuitive UI
- Deleted lines in the diff view are now displayed with strikethrough, making it easier to identify them
- The code parsing function now properly handles file structures, enabling accurate diff generation

### Testing
1. Generate a plugin
2. Make changes to the plugin code
3. Create a new version
4. Verify that change indicators appear in the file explorer
5. Click on the eye icon to open the diff modal
6. Test with multiple versions to ensure the correct changes are displayed

            e.stopPropagation()
            onViewChanges(fullPath)
          }}
        >
          <Eye className="h-3.5 w-3.5" />
        </button>
      </TooltipTrigger>
      <TooltipContent>
        <p>View file changes</p>
      </TooltipContent>
    </Tooltip>
  </TooltipProvider>
)}
```

2. Enhanced the `DiffViewModal` to add strikethrough for deleted lines:

  // Implementation to add a file to the structure
}
```

2. Make changes to the plugin code
3. Create a new version
4. Verify that change indicators appear in the file explorer
5. Click on the eye icon to open the diff modal
6. Test with multiple versions to ensure the correct changes are displayed

## Enhancement: Added "View Changes" Button for Easier Diff Access

### Issue Identified
Users were having difficulty finding how to view the changes between different versions of the code. The file explorer was supposed to show indicators for modified files, but it wasn't immediately obvious how to access the diff view.

### Analysis
We needed to make the diff view feature more accessible and obvious to users. While the file explorer was designed to show change indicators, adding a dedicated button would make this functionality more discoverable.

### Changes Made
1. Added a "View Changes" button next to the version dropdown:

```tsx
{currentVersionIndex > 0 && (
  <Button 
    variant="outline" 
    size="sm" 
    className="text-xs flex items-center gap-1"
    onClick={() => {
      if (currentVersionIndex > 0 && codeVersions[currentVersionIndex]) {
        handleViewVersionChanges(codeVersions[currentVersionIndex].id);
      }
    }}
  >
    <Eye className="h-3.5 w-3.5 mr-1" />
    View Changes
  </Button>
)}
```

2. The button is only shown when there's a previous version to compare with (currentVersionIndex > 0)
3. Clicking the button opens the diff modal showing all changes between the current version and the previous version
4. Added proper null handling for localStorage items to fix TypeScript errors:

```tsx
if (savedMessages) {
  try {
    setMessages(JSON.parse(savedMessages as string))
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Error parsing saved messages:", e)
  }
}
```

### Implementation Details
- The button is positioned next to the version dropdown for easy access
- It uses the `Eye` icon from Lucide React to provide a visual cue
- The button is only visible when there are at least two versions (so there's something to compare)
- When clicked, it calls the `handleViewVersionChanges` function with the current version's ID
- This function sets the selected version for diff and opens the diff modal

### Expected Results
- Users can now easily access the diff view by clicking the "View Changes" button
- The button is prominently displayed next to the version dropdown, making it more discoverable
- The eye icon provides a visual cue that this is for viewing changes
- The diff modal shows all changes between the current version and the previous version

### Testing
1. Generate a plugin
2. Make changes to the code
3. Create a new version
4. Verify that the "View Changes" button appears next to the version dropdown
5. Click the button and confirm that the diff modal opens showing the changes between versions
6. Test with multiple versions to ensure the correct changes are displayed
7. Verify that both the split view and unified view work correctly in the diff modal

## [2024-06-24] Fixed DiffViewModal Display Issues

### Issue Identified
The DiffViewModal component had several display issues:
1. The modal had a transparent background, making text difficult to read
2. No content was being displayed in the diff columns
3. The Split/Unified view buttons weren't functioning correctly

### Analysis
After examining the DiffViewModal component, we identified several issues:
1. Missing background color classes on various elements
2. Tab switching functionality wasn't properly implemented
3. Inconsistent styling between the split and unified views
4. Poor contrast between text and background in some areas

### Changes Made
1. **Added White Background**:
   ```jsx
   <DialogContent className="max-w-4xl h-[80vh] flex flex-col bg-white">
   <DialogHeader className="bg-white">
   <div className="flex flex-1 gap-4 overflow-hidden bg-white">
   ```

2. **Fixed Tab Switching Functionality**:
   ```jsx
   const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<string>("split")
   
   <Tabs 
     defaultValue="split" 
     value={activeTab}
     onValueChange={setActiveTab}
     className="h-full flex flex-col"
   >
   ```

3. **Improved Content Display**:
   - Added proper background colors to content areas
   - Enhanced contrast for better readability
   - Added consistent padding and spacing
   - Ensured consistent styling between split and unified views

4. **Enhanced Visual Hierarchy**:
   - Changed background colors from muted to specific gray values
   - Added `py-0.5` to line elements for better spacing
   - Used `bg-gray-200` for headers and `bg-gray-50` for content areas
   - Added white background to code blocks

5. **Improved Button Styling**:
   ```jsx
   <Button onClick={onClose} className="bg-black hover:bg-gray-800 text-white">Close</Button>
   ```

### Expected Results
- The modal now has a solid white background for better readability
- Content is properly displayed in both split and unified views
- The Split/Unified view buttons work correctly, switching between views
- Better visual hierarchy with improved contrast and spacing
- Consistent styling throughout the modal

### Testing
1. Generate a plugin
2. Make changes to the code
3. Create a new version
4. Click the "View Changes" button to open the diff modal
5. Verify that the modal has a white background
6. Check that file content is properly displayed in both columns
7. Test switching between Split and Unified views
8. Verify that line additions and deletions are correctly highlighted

## [2024-06-24] Fixed File Change Detection and Diff View Display

### Issue Identified
The diff view modal was not displaying any files in the file tree, and consequently, no code changes were visible. The modal showed a white background but no content.

### Analysis
After examining the code, we identified several issues:
1. The file change detection system wasn't properly parsing PHP code into separate files
2. The DiffViewModal component didn't handle the case when no file changes were detected
3. The file structure parsing logic needed improvement to better identify different PHP files

### Changes Made
1. **Enhanced File Structure Parsing**:
   ```jsx
   const parseCodeToFileStructure = (code: string): FileStructure[] => {
     // Create a new structure from the code
     const structure: FileStructure[] = [];
     
     // Try to parse using file markers first
     const fileMarkerRegex = /\/\*\s*FILE:\s*([^\s]+)\s*\*\/\s*([^]*?)(?=\/\*\s*FILE:|$)/g;
     let match;
     let foundFiles = false;
     
     while ((match = fileMarkerRegex.exec(code)) !== null) {
       foundFiles = true;
       const filePath = match[1].trim();
       const fileContent = match[2].trim();
       
       // Add the file to the structure
       addFileToStructure(structure, filePath, fileContent);
     }
